  Set 2:

  1. One of the CSS declarations below is incomplete. Which one? How do you make it complete?
  2. Assuming complete CSS, how wide will the paragraph be (on screen) from the left edge of the
     left border to the right edge of the right border? How could you make it exactly 100px?
-->

<style>
p {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  border: 10px blue;
  padding: 20px 30px;
  margin: 8px;
}
</style>

<p>
  I am a little paragraph, short and stout.
